-- title: Research on Trump followers


-- Goal: Hillary points out that Trump's followers are a bunch of deporables. This is an interesting claim, and motivate us to learn about social structures of Trump's followers are beglonging to.





-- Proposal and Data Colloection:
  
#1 download Trump's followers list -- they may not be trump's supporters.

#2 download info about Trump' followers, and figure out who are the supporters -- NLP

#3 Clustering Trump's supporters






--- Proposal and Data collection
# for each of Trump of tweet, get the set of users who retweeted it; 
 -- impossible, at most 100 retweets; alternatively, download all the users, all their timelines, and reconstruct. 
 -- streaming may be able to get the tweets from now, not past; I download using searchstring ="@realDonnaldTrump", get 70k twittes in 4 hours.
 -- use data base at Journalism dept, they may have stored a lot of retweets of Trump's old tweets.
 
# a tweets \times users matrix  ~ 1.3K \times 11M
# analyze this matrix.
